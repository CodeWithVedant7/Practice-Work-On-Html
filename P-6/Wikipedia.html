    <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist widely acknowledged as one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.</p>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His family moved to Munich shortly afterward, where he began his education at the Luitpold Gymnasium. However, Einstein clashed with the authorities and struggled with the rigid teaching style.</p>
    <h2>Scientific Achievements</h2>
    <p>Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers, including the special theory of relativity in 1905 and the general theory of relativity in 1915. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>

        <li>Photoelectric Effect</li>
        <li>Brownian Motion</li>
        <li>Bose-Einstein Condensate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Later Years</h2>
    <p>In his later years, Einstein was a prominent advocate for civil rights and nuclear disarmament. He emigrated to the United States in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and became a U.S. citizen in 1940.</p>
